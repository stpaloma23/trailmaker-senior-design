This website is a result of my reflecting on my time at NYU and thinking about the things I wish I knew and the guidance I wish I had. I’m not a first-generation college student, however, I'm a low-income college student who went to an underfunded public school that lacked resources. I found myself navigating the college process with little guidance from the people around me. I had to search through countless videos and articles online to find the advice that would benefit me the most. At times it was an extremely isolating and difficult process, trying to pave a way for myself that I hadn’t seen before. It was with the guidance of online resources, organizations, and a robust support system I was able to successfully graduate from NYU, and land a job at a top-rated company as a software engineer."

I wanted to create a resource where first-generation and low-income college students can create their own paths, with the guidance of resources curated to help them along the way. As a low-income college student coming from a less privileged background entering an elite university, I realized that the main differentiator between me and my peers wasn't necessarily intelligence level, but rather an issue of access. I found myself in the beginning trying to play catch up with my peers who started off a few steps ahead of me due to the resources they had access to while in high school. I hope this resource can give you a leg up, and help you navigate this journey with confidence and security in the decisions you make throughout this long and challenging process.           "

Furthermore, if you are having personal challenges that may interfere with your academic performance and you need an extension on an assignment or an incomplete on a course, having a relationship with your professor will help you through this process. From my experience as a professor and that of my colleagues, office hours are highly underused or are used by the high-achieving students who need it least. Developing a relationship with your professors also helps when you want a reference because you will be more than a name on a transcript and/or resume."

Also, it is important to be assertive with your professors if you are having challenges getting your work done. Professors much prefer you try to find a way to get your work submitted on time or to give you an extension, rather than hearing excuses for a low grade or not submitting the assignment. The same goes for the financial office: If you think you may have trouble paying your tuition bill, it is good to go to the student aid office and try to negotiate."
