But every time I showed the slightest bit of excitement about getting a degree, my parents gave me a nervous smile."

Sure, they loved the idea of me accomplishing everything they couldn’t, but they were afraid that their lack of experience would be of no help once I entered into the world as a first-generation student and professional."

But instead, I got used to swimming in the deep end and made note of every failure and every feat that would one day help other first-generation professionals find their place in the working world.

'Career advisers and career centers should be able to help with that.'\n\nStudents can also consult careers centers to learn more about the internship financial assistance opportunities available at their school.
