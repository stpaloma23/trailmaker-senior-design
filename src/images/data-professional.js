The chunky 2003 desktop computer sitting in my living room was the first thing I ran to after finishing my homework. And the more comfortable I got with the keyboard, the more I realized I wanted to go to school as long as I possibly could – college was a must. But every time I showed the slightest bit of excitement about getting a degree, my parents gave me a nervous smile."

Neither of them knew anything about applying to college, choosing a major, or financing the whole four years. Sure, they loved the idea of me accomplishing everything they couldn’t, but they were afraid that their lack of experience would be of no help once I entered into the world as a first-generation student and professional."

But instead, I got used to swimming in the deep end and made note of every failure and every feat that would one day help other first-generation professionals find their place in the working world. Looking back, these are the top pieces of advice I collected through my own job search and professional journey."

I didn’t have family to crash with and had no check coming in to pay for rent.

You might be a first-generation graduate with little guidance, but you also might speak a second language, or you taught yourself a particular hobby because you’re so accustomed to learning new things on your own.
